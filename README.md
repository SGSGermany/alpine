Alpine Linux
============

[`alpine`](https://ghcr.io/sgsgermany/alpine) is [@SGSGermany](https://github.com/SGSGermany)'s base image for containers based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/). This image is built *daily* at 21:20 UTC on top of the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/SGSGermany/alpine/actions/workflows/container-publish.yml).

Rebuilds are triggered only if Alpine publishes a new patch release, or if one of Alpine's Mini Root Filesystem packages were updated. Currently we create images for **Alpine 3.21**, **Alpine 3.20**, **Alpine 3.19**, and **Alpine 3.18**. Please note that we might add or drop branches at any time.

All images are tagged with their full Alpine version string, build date and build job number (e.g. `v3.15.4-20190618.1658821493.1`). The latest build of an Alpine release is additionally tagged without the build information (e.g. `v3.15.4`). If an image represents the latest version of an Alpine release branch, it is additionally tagged without the patch version (e.g. `v3.15`), and without the minor version (e.g. `v3`); both without and with build information (e.g. `v3.15-20190618.1658821493.1` and `v3-20190618.1658821493.1`). The latest build of the latest Alpine version is furthermore tagged with `latest`.

Please note that we disable [Alpine's `community` repository](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=edge&repo=community&arch=x86_64&maintainer=) by default. The reason is its limited support: In the [`main` repository](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=edge&repo=main&arch=x86_64&maintainer=) we can expect the full support cycle of 2 years, but `community` is only supported for about 6 months, i.e. until the next stable release (see [Alpine wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Repositories) for more information). If you want to install packages from the `community` repository, make sure to always use Alpine's latest stable branch. You can then either re-enable the repository as a whole (run `sed -i -E 's/^@community (.+)$/\1/' /etc/apk/repositories`), or install single packages by tagging them with `@community` (e.g. `apk add --no-cache package-name@community`).
